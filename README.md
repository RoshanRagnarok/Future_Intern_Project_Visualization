# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Data Cleaning

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset, which provides valuable insights into the passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration of various features, and statistical analysis to understand factors influencing survival rates.

## Dataset
The dataset contains key information about Titanic passengers, including:

- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Indicates survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Represents the ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Age**: The age of each passenger.
- **SibSp**: The number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: The number of parents/children aboard.
- **Fare**: The fare paid for the ticket.

## Requirements
To run this analysis, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas and Numpy

## Analysis and Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Start by importing the necessary libraries to handle data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Read the Dataset**: Load the Titanic dataset from a CSV file for analysis.

3. **Data Inspection**: Examine the first few rows of the dataset and check the data types of each column to understand its structure.

4. **Identify Categorical and Numerical Columns**: Classify columns into categorical and numerical types to facilitate analysis.

5. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and manage missing data. Common strategies include filling missing values with the median for numerical columns and dropping rows with remaining missing values.

6. **Select Relevant Columns**: Create a subset of the dataset containing only the columns of interest for detailed analysis.

7. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate key statistics such as mean, mode, median, and standard deviation for the selected numerical columns. Descriptive statistics provide an overview of the data.

8. **Explore Categorical Columns**: Investigate unique values and analyze relationships between categorical features, such as gender and survival status. This can include calculating average ages based on gender and survival.

## Results
The analysis reveals insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and the impact of various factors on these rates. The data cleaning steps ensure the dataset is ready for accurate analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning and analysis in understanding the Titanic dataset, highlighting trends and statistics related to passenger survival.
